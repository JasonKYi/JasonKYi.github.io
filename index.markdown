# About me

My name is (Jason) Kexing Ying and I am a PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Xue-Mei Li 
within the chair of [Stochastic Analysis](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stoan/). Before beginning my PhD, I completed my master's 
degree in mathematics (Part III) at the University of Cambridge and before that, I had completed my bachelor's degree in 
mathematics at the Imperial College. I am also active in the formalisation of mathematics using the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io/).
You can find some of my contributions within the mathematical library for Lean - [`mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib).
I mostly formalise results within probability theory although I have also previously contributed towards the formalisation of 
parts of linear algebra and group theory. My work in formalisation has resulted in one publication: 

[A Formalization of Doobâ€™s Martingale Convergence Theorems in mathlib](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05578), 
In Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs.
