<p class="Section"><i>3 Mar. 2024</i> &ensp; Precompactness in the Total Variational Topology</p>
    
    <p class="BodyText">
        Let \(X\) be a Polish space and let \(d\) be a metric compatible with the topology of \(X\). By replacing 
        \(d\) by \(d \wedge 1\), we may assume that \(d \le 1\). Denoting \(\mathcal{M}(X)\) the space of 
        probability measures on \(X\), we saw that for a sequence of measures 
        \((\mu_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathcal{M}(X)\) and \(\mu \in \mathcal{M}(X)\), we have that 
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:wasserstein-weak}
        d_1(\mu_n, \mu) \to 0 \iff \mu_n \rightharpoonup \mu.
        \end{equation}
        where \(d_1\) denotes the Wasserstein distance of order 1 corresponding to the metric \(d\) and 
        \(\rightharpoonup\) denotes weak convergence. In this note we remark a similar condition for convergence 
        in total variation. 
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Recall that Lusin's theorem for Radon measures states that: Let \(X\) be a locally compact Polish space 
        and take \(\mu \in \mathcal{M}(X)\) (so \(\mu\) is automatically a Radon measure), \(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) 
        a bounded measurable function and \(\epsilon > 0\). Then, there exists a compact set \(K \subseteq X\) 
        such that \(f\) is continuous on \(K\) and \(\mu(K) \ge 1 - \epsilon\). This motivates the following definition.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Definition.</b>
        Given a set of measures \(M \subseteq \mathcal{M}(X)\), we say that \(M\) is strongly tight if for all 
        \(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) bounded measurable and \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a compact set \(K \subseteq X\)
        such that \(f\) is continuous on \(K\) and for all \(\mu \in M\), \(\mu(K) \ge 1 - \epsilon\).
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        We remark that, by applying Lusin's theorem to \(\epsilon / n\), it is clear that any finite family of measures 
        is automatically strongly tight. Moreover, we see that if \(\mu_n \to \mu\) in total variation, then 
        \(\{\mu_n, \mu\}_n\) is also strongly tight. Finally, as the name suggests, it is clear that if 
        \(M \subseteq \mathcal{M}(X)\) is strongly tight, then it is also tight.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        By slightly modifying the proof of convergence in Wasserstein distance implies weak convergence, we observe the following 
        relation between convergence in Wasserstein distance and convergence in total variation.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proposition.</i>
        Let \((\mu_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathcal{M}(X)\) and \(\mu \in \mathcal{M}(X)\). 
        Then, \(\mu_n \to \mu\) in total variation if and only if \((\mu_n)_n\) is strongly tight and \(d_1(\mu_n, \mu) \to 0\).
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        The forward direction is obvious so we only prove the reverse. Suppose that \((\mu_n)_n\) is strongly tight 
        and \(d_1(\mu_n, \mu) \to 0\). Then, taking \(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) be a bounded measurable function, 
        we will show that
        \[\left|\int f d \mu_n - \int f d \mu\right| \to 0.\]
        Fixing \(\epsilon > 0\), by strong tightness, there exists some \(K\) compact such that \(f\) is uniformly continuous on \(K\) and 
        \(\mu(K^c), \mu_n(K^c) < \epsilon\) for all \(n\). Thus, there exists some \(\delta > 0\) such that 
        for all \(x, y \in \Delta_\delta := \{(x, y) \in K^2 : d(x, y) < \delta\}\), we have \(|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon\).
    </p>
    
    <p class="BodyText">
        Moreover, since \(d_1(\mu_n, \mu) \to 0\), there exists a sequence of couplings 
        \(\Pi_n \in \mathcal{C}(\mu_n, \mu)\) such that 
        \[\int d(x, y) \Pi_n(d x, d y) \to 0.\]
        So, 
        \[0 \leftarrow \int d(x, y) \Pi_n(d x, d y) \ge \int_{\Delta_\delta^c \cap K^2} d(x, y) \Pi_n(d x, d y) 
            \ge \delta \Pi_n(\Delta_\delta^c \cap K^2) \ge 0\]
        implying \(\Pi_n(\Delta_\delta^c \cap K^2) < \epsilon\) for sufficiently large \(n\). Thus, for sufficiently large \(n\),
        we have that 
        \begin{align*}
            \left|\int f d \mu_n - \int f d \mu\right| 
            & = \left|\int (f(x) - f(y)) \Pi_n(d x, d y)\right|\\
            & \le \left|\int_{\Delta_\delta} (f(x) - f(y)) \Pi_n(d x, d y)\right| 
            + \left|\int_{\Delta_\delta^c \cap K^2} (f(x) - f(y)) \Pi_n(d x, d y)\right|\\
            & + \left|\int_{X \times K^c} (f(x) - f(y)) \Pi_n(d x, d y)\right| + 
            \left|\int_{K^c \times X} (f(x) - f(y)) \Pi_n(d x, d y)\right|\\
            & \le \epsilon + 2|f|_\infty \epsilon + 2|f|_\infty \mu_n(X)\mu(K^c) + 2|f|_\infty \mu_n(K^c)\mu(K)\\
            & \le \epsilon(1 + 6|f|_\infty).
        \end{align*}
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Consequently, taking \(\epsilon \to 0\) gives the desired limit.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align: right">ðŸŽ‰</p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Alternatively, one can also obtain the above by using the equivalence of weak convergence and convergence 
        is Wasserstein distance. In particular, 
        we note that for a given bounded measurable function \(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(\mu \in \mathcal{M}(X)\), 
        there exists a continuous function \(\tilde f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) such that 
        \[\left| \int f d \mu - \int \tilde f d \mu \right| < \epsilon.\] 
        This follows by Lusin's theorem and Tietze extension. Hence, in a similar vein, in the case where we have 
        strong tightness, applying Tietze extension and triangle inequality provides convergence in total variation 
        given weak convergence.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        In any case, this provides a characterization of precompactness in the total variational topology.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proposition.</i>
        Let \(M \subseteq \mathcal{M}(X)\) be a family of measures. Then \(M\) is strongly tight if and only if it is
        precompact in the total variational topology.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        The forward direction is simple. Indeed, if \(M\) is strongly tight, then it is tight and so any sequence 
        of measures \((\mu_n)\) in \(M\) has a weakly convergent subsequence \(\mu_{n_k} \to \mu \in \mathcal{M}(X)\). 
        However, as \((\mu_{n_k})\) is also strongly tight, the previous lemma show that this convergence 
        can be taking to be instead convergence in total variation. Thus, any sequence in \(M\) has a convergent
        subsequence in total variation which implies that \(M\) is precompact.

    <i>27 Oct. 2023</i> &ensp; Random Compact Sets in Polish Spaces</p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Here is a fun puzzle I thought about today:
        Let \(X\) be a polish space and \(K\) a random compact set of \(X\) (i.e. a random variable taking values 
        in compact subsets of \(X\)). Fix \(\epsilon > 0\), does there necessarily exists a deterministic compact 
        set \(A\) such that \(\mathbb{P}(K \subseteq A) \ge 1 - \epsilon\)?
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        This question seems quite similar to the notion of <i>tightness</i> for measures and it would not 
        come as a shock that the solution to this question uses tightness of a single measure on Polish spaces.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Define \(\mu\) such that
        \[\mu(B) = \mathbb{P}(K \subsetneq B),\]
        it is not difficult to see that \(\mu\) defines a measure on \(\mathcal{B}(X)\) (note that strict subset 
        is necessary as \(K\) might achieve \(\varnothing\) with positive probability).
        Thus, as a measure on \(X\) is tight, there exists a compact set \(A\) such that 
        \[\mathbb{P}(K \subseteq A) \ge \mathbb{P}(K \subsetneq A) = \mu(A) \ge 1 - \epsilon\]
        which is precisely what we needed.

    <i>30 Jul. 2022</i> &ensp; Order Connected Sets are Measurable in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)</p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        YaÃ«l Dillies was reading a book by Bollobas in which he claimed without proof that an order connected set (with respect to the pointwise ordering) 
        in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is measurable. YaÃ«l asked on Discord if anyone knows how to prove it. This short note contains my proof of this fact.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Definition.</b>
        Given a partially ordered set \((X, (\le))\), \(S \subseteq X\) is said to be order connected if for all \(x, y \in S\), 
        \[[x, y] := \{z \mid x \le z \le y\} \subseteq S.\]
    </p>   

    <p class="BodyText">
        Equipping \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with the point-wise ordering (i.e. for 
        \(x := (x_i)_{i = 1}^n,  y := (y_i)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^n\), \(x \le y\) if and only if 
        \(x_n \le y_n\) for all \(n = 1, \cdots, n\)), \(\mathbb{R}^n\) form a partially ordered set and we 
        can therefore talk about its order connected subsets.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Theorem.</b>
        \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is Lebesgue measurable if \(S\) is order connected with respect to the 
        point-wise ordering on \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
    </p>
    
    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        Defining \(S^+ := \{x \mid \exists \ y \in S, y \le x\}\) and \(S^- := \{x \mid \exists \ y \in s, x \le y\}\), we 
        observe \(S = S^+ \cap S^-\). Therefore, it is sufficient to show that \(S^+\) and \(S^-\) are measurable. 
        We will show measurability for \(S^+\) while the case for \(S^-\) is similar. 
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        It is clear that for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), \(\{x\}^+\) is measurable. So, defining \(Q := S^+ \cap \mathbb{Q}^n\),
        \[Q^+ = \bigcup_{q \in Q} \{q\}^+ \subseteq S^+\]
        is measurable. Furthermore, \(S^+ \setminus Q^+ \subseteq \partial S^+\) since for all \(x \in S^\circ\), there exists some 
        open neighborhood \(B \subseteq S^\circ\) of \(x\); so, as \(Q\) is dense in \(S^+\), there exists an element 
        \(q \in Q \cap B\) such that \(q \le x\) and hence, \(x \in \{q\}^+ \subseteq Q^+\). Now, as the Lebesgue \(\sigma\)-algebra is 
        complete and \(S^+ = Q^+ \cup (S^+ \setminus Q^+)\), it suffices to show that \(\partial S^+\) is a null-set.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        To show \(\text{Leb}(\partial S^+) = 0\) we will invoke the Lebesgue density theorem. Namely, by showing 
        \[\partial S^+ \subseteq \{x \in \overline{S^+} \mid d(x) \notin \{0, 1\}\}\]
        where 
        \[d(x) := \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} d_\epsilon(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} 
            \frac{\text{Leb}(\overline{S^+} \cap B_\epsilon(x))}{\text{Leb}(B_\epsilon(x))}\]
        as \(\overline{S^+}\) is closed and hence measurable, the Lebesgue density theorem tells us 
        \[\text{Leb}(\partial S^+) \le \text{Leb}(\{x \in \overline{S^+} \mid d(x) \notin \{0, 1\}\}) = 0.\]
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Indeed, for all \(x \in \partial S^+, \epsilon > 0\), \(\overline{S^+} \cap B_\epsilon(x)\) must contain 
        the with the right-upper quadrant of the ball by the very definition of \(S^+\), implying 
        \(\text{Leb}(\overline{S^+} \cap B_\epsilon(x)) \gtrapprox 2^{-n} \text{Leb}(B_\epsilon(x))\) bounding 
        \(d(x)\) from below. Similarly, \(\overline{S^+}^c \cap B_\epsilon(x)\) must contain the left-bottom 
        quadrant of the ball as otherwise \(x\) is contained by some \(\{y\}^+\) for some \(y \in \overline{S}^+\) 
        contradicting \(x \in \partial S^+\). Hence, \(\text{Leb}(\overline{S^+} \cap B_\epsilon(x)) \lessapprox 
        (1 - 2^{-n}) \text{Leb}(B_\epsilon(x))\) bounding \(d(x)\) from above and so, proving the required 
        inclusion.

    <i>3 Apr. 2022</i> &ensp; Preorder Cannot Generate the Cofinite Topology on Infinite Sets</p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        Kevin Buzzard asked on Discord whether or not 
        the topology generated by any preorder on \(\mathbb{C}\) can equal to either the usual topology or the cofinite topology.
        The first question is rather easy to one can take the base of the usual topology to be the boxes and of which
        is generated by the preorder 
        \[z < w \iff \text{Re}(z) < \text{Re}(w) \text{ and } \text{Im}(z) < \text{Im}(w).\]
        The second part is a bit more tricky and it turns out that the following theorem is true:
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Theorem.</b> 
        Given a infinite set \(X\), there does not exist a preorder on \(X\) which generates the cofinite topology.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        We will in this short article provide a proof for this theorem.
        For reference, let us first quickly recall some basic definitions from lattice theory.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Definition.</b> 
        For a given set \(X\), a preorder \((\le)\) on \(X\) is a binary relation such that 
        it is reflexive: for all \(x \in X\), \(x \le x\); and
        it is transitive: for all \(x, y, z \in X\), if \(x \le y\) and \(y \le z\), then \(x \le z\).
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Definition.</b>
        For a given set \(X\), a strict order \((<)\) on \(X\) is a binary relation such that 
        it is irreflexive: for all \(x < X\), \(\neg x < x\); and 
        it is transitive: for all \(x, y, z \in X\), if \(x \le y\) and \(y \le z\), then \(x \le z\).
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        It is clear that every preorder has an associated strict order by setting \(x < y\) whenever \(x \le y\) and \(\neg y \le x\).
        With this in mind, the topology generated the preorder \((\le)\) is defined to be is the smallest topology such that all sets of the 
        form \(\{y \in X \mid y < x\}\) and \(\{y \in X \mid x < y\}\) are open for any \(x \in X\) where \((<)\) is the strict 
        order associated with the preorder. 
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        On the other hand, the cofinite topology on \(X\) is the topology in which the open sets are precisely 
        the sets whose complements are finite or the empty set.
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText">
        <b>Proposition.</b>
        Given a infinite set \(X\), there does not exist a preorder on \(X\) which generates the cofinite topology.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        Suppose there exists a preorder \((\le)\) with the associated strict order \((<)\) such that the order topology generated by it is the same as the cofinite 
        topology. For the cofinite topology, any non-empty open sets must intersect, and thus, since \(\{z \mid x < z\}\) and 
        \(\{z \mid z < x\}\) are open in the order topology, their intersection is nonempty for all \(x\) if neither sets are empty. 
        But, if this is the case, there exists some \(z\) such that \(z < x < z\) implying \(z < z\) which is a contradiction. 
        Hence, at least one of the set is empty.
    </p>
        
    <p class="BodyText">
        Now, denoting \(U_+\) the set of \(x\) for which \(\{z \mid z < x\}\) is non-empty (so \(\{z \mid x < z\} = \varnothing\) for all \(x \in U_+\)), as 
        \(\{z \mid z < x\}\) is open, \(\{z \mid \neg z < x\}\) is finite for all \(x \in U_+\). As for all \(x, y \in U_+\), if \(y < x\), 
        then \(x \in \{z \mid y < z\}\) contradicting \(\{z \mid y < z\} = \varnothing\), \(\neg y < x\) for all \(x, y \in U_+\). Hence, 
        \(y \in \{z \mid \neg z < x\}\) for all \(y \in U_+\). Thus, as \(\{z \mid \neg z < x\}\) is finite, so is \(U_+\). 
    </p>   

    <p class="BodyText">
        Similarly, defining \(U_-\) the set of \(x\) for which \(\{z \mid x < z\}\) is non-empty, by the same argument, \(U_-\) is finite. 
        Hence, \(\{z \mid x < z\}\) and \(\{z \mid z < x\}\) is empty for all but finitely many \(x\). But then, the topology generated by 
        the preorder has a finite base, implying only finitely many sets are open which is a contradiction.
